# Development Rules

Always start coding sessions with **بسم الله الرحمن الرحیم**.

## Code Modification Rules

1. **No Unsolicited Refactoring**
   - Do not modify or refactor working code unless explicitly requested
   - Keep existing code structure intact if it's functioning correctly
   - Focus only on fixing actual bugs and issues

2. **Feature Changes**
   - Only implement new features when specifically asked
   - Do not add "nice to have" enhancements without explicit request
   - Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested task

3. **Code Style**
   - Maintain the existing code style
   - Do not change formatting or structure for aesthetic reasons
   - Follow the project's established patterns

4. **Dependencies**
   - Do not update or add new dependencies without explicit approval
   - Keep using existing libraries and versions that work

5. **Documentation**
   - Only update documentation for new changes
   - Do not modify existing documentation unless specifically asked

## When Making Changes

1. **Scope**
   - Stay strictly within the scope of the requested change
   - If additional changes might be beneficial, suggest them but don't implement without approval

2. **Testing**
   - Test only the modified components
   - Do not add new tests for existing functionality unless requested

3. **Error Handling**
   - Maintain existing error handling patterns
   - Do not enhance error handling without explicit request

Remember: The goal is to maintain stability. If it works, don't touch it!

Don't use "import { WSEventType } from '../shared/types/websocket';" instead use "import { WSEventType } from '@shared/types/websocket';".
